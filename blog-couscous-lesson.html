    <h1>The Day I Learned to Make Couscous in Imsouane</h1>
    <p><em>By Almarse Cooking Class</em></p>
    <p>I thought I knew how to steam couscous—until Aissa handed me the real deal. No shortcuts. No bags. Just semolina, hands, water, and patience.</p>

    <p>I was allowed to fluff. That’s it. Maybe next week, I’ll pour the broth.</p>
