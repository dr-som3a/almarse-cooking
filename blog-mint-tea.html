    <h1>How Mint Tea Became a Symbol of Moroccan Hospitality</h1>
    <p><em>By Almarse Cooking Class</em></p>
    <p>Mint tea isn't just a drink in Morocco. It's a gesture of welcome, a sign of peace, and an art of balance. The way it's poured, the height, the glass, the first sip—every step has intention.</p>
    <p>At Almarse, we don’t just teach you how to brew it—we teach you how to serve it with soul.</p>
    <p>And yes, the mint must be fresh. Always.</p>
